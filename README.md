- A bit about me: 

  I am Abhinandan Saha and I want to study and build my career in Computer Science. I am very inquisitive and I have a hunger for knowledge, to innovate, to learn and I love challenges, I am very hard working and always on the lookout for opportunities to exercise my academic and intellectual abilities. In the world of computers, programming and computer science and engineering, as a whole, interests me a lot, as it requires logical thinking, and thinking out of the box, to solve today‚Äôs problems, which creates a base for computer application. I am a firm believer in diversity of thought and disciplines as drivers of progress and I believe that through a  beautiful amalgamation of ideas and different people, does one flourish and contribute impactfully and meaningfully. 
  
  Solving problems, doing new things, challenging myself ‚Äì this is what I want. Computer Science holds great value for humanity and has the power to change the world for the good and betterment of all. I want to train myself in this discipline to be of service to humanity and to the greater good. I want to do something impactful and meaningful, and I am certain Computer Science would equip me with the necessary knowledge to do it. 
  
- Education and skills:
  - Work: I have created my first application on my own. I have named the app - SPTT. It enables users to signup to create their account and login to their account and work in their own, personalized workspace. It aids users by helping them typing out large documents without requiring to even touch their computers ‚Äì through their speech. It also implements save functions and audio recorders and a vast multitude of other functionalities to give the user a complete and streamlined experience.  
            Github link: https://abhinandan991.github.io/SPTT/ ( This readme file contains all the thought process and the challenges that went into making it and its functionalities (The DEVELOPEMENT section)).   
  - Certificates: 
    - Proffessional Certificate (Computer Science for AI)
      - CS50x (Harvardx) || Computational thinking and Computer Science with Python
      - CS50 AI (Harvardx) || Introduction to AI
    - Professional Skills (IBM SkillsBuild)
    - Professional Certificate (IBM Data Science)

  - High School: Studied in South Point High School. 
     
     Scored 91.4% in Standard X, 91.6% in Standard XII(Science), 91.6 percentile in JEE and in the 99th percetile (1500/1600 in SAT). 
     
     I've had computer science as a high school major and thus have been instructed in it and explored rigorous and advanced concepts and algorithms. I‚Äôve collaborated with peers on multiple projects and have submitted major final projects.    

  - Skill building: For the past 4 years, I've had computer science as a high school major and thus have been instructed in it and explored rigorous and advanced concepts and    algorithms. I‚Äôve collaborated with peers on multiple projects and have submitted major final projects for every year.  

     In the last one year, I have completed, and am on course to completing multiple online course offerings from universities and institutions such as Harvard, IBM and MIT, and    have completed IBM Data Science Professional certification from IBM Developer Skills network to gain professional skills in the area of data science. I have also enrolled myself in online modules to teach myself in-depth concepts of computational thinking and have learnt and mastered five computing languages: Python, Java, C, HTML/JavaScript, and MySQL. 

      I believe that practical application and hands on learning serve as the truest gateway to gain core understanding about subjects, and with this vision I have completed 7   projects related to AI and machine learning and worked on 9 data science projects and 1 capstone project for SpaceX‚Äôs launch success prediction and analysis. I have learned  about the fundamental concepts of AI and as a part of the coursework for an online course (Harvardx ‚Äì CS50 AI), I have worked on and completed its seven projects and have  implemented worker functions for the proper functioning of the AI in problems pertaining to problems such as, Optimization, Best path solve, PageRank, speech (parser and answering questions), Inference, knowledge etc. 
  I have also participated in IBM's Training network course for professional skill building and gave exams and passed with a grade above 90% on real world problems.
