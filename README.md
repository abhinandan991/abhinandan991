- A bit about me: 

  I am Abhinandan Saha and I want to study and build my career in Computer Science. I am very inquisitive and I have a hunger for knowledge, to innovate, to learn and I love challenges, I am very hard working and always on the lookout for opportunities to exercise my academic and intellectual abilities. In the world of computers, programming and computer science and engineering, as a whole, interests me a lot, as it requires logical thinking, and thinking out of the box, to solve today‚Äôs problems, which creates a base for computer application. Solving problems, doing new things, challenging myself ‚Äì this is what I want. Computer Science holds great value for humanity and has the power to change the world for the good and betterment of all. I want to train myself in this discipline to be of service to humanity and to the greater good. I want to do something impactful and meaningful, and I am certain Computer Science would equip me with the necessary knowledge to do it.  
- Education and skills:
  - Work: I have created my first application on my own. I have named the app - SPTT. It enables users to signup to create their account and login to their account and work in their own, personalized workspace. It aids users by helping them typing out large documents without requiring to even touch their computers ‚Äì through their speech. It also implements save functions and audio recorders and a vast multitude of other functionalities to give the user a complete and streamlined experience.  
            Github link: https://abhinandan991.github.io/SPTT/ ( This readme file contains all the thought process and the challenges that went into making it and its functionalities (The DEVELOPEMENT section)).   
  - Certificates: 
    - Proffessional Certificate (Computer Science for AI)
      - CS50x (Harvardx) || Computational thinking and Computer Science with Python
      - CS50 AI (Harvardx) || Introduction to AI
    - Introduction to DataScience with Python (IBM)
  
  - High School: I've had computer science as a high school major and thus have been instructed in it and explored rigorous and advanced concepts and algorithms. I‚Äôve collaborated with peers on multiple projects and have submitted major final projects. I have learned about the fundamental concepts of AI and as a part of the coursework for an online course (Harvardx ‚Äì CS50 AI), I have worked on and completed its seven projects and have implemented worker functions for the proper functioning of the AI in problems pertaining to problems such as, Optimization, Best path solve, PageRank, speech (parser and answering questions), Inference, knowledge etc.   

  - Skill building: I  have completed and am on course to completing multiple online course offerings from universities such as Harvard, IBM and MIT and have certificates for completion,  and am pursuing professional certificates from online resources to train myself in the areas of Data Science, AI etc. I have also explored online resources to teach myself in-depth concepts of computational thinking and have taught myself to use 4-5 computing languages (Python, Java, C, HTML/Javascript, MySQL etc.).    

  - Projects:
    - Created application (SPTT) || Github link: https://abhinandan991.github.io/SPTT/
    - 7 projects (Harvardx CS50 AI)
      - degree of webpage
      - tictacto ai
      - minesweeper ai
      - webpage pagerank calculator 
      - hereditaru traits presence probability
      - crossword solver
      - traffic sign recogniser
      - human shopping behavior analyzer
      - Q/A capability
    - Encrypting Data (Basic)(Hackerank)
    - Account Management (Basic)(School final project)
    - Finance website creation (Stock portfolio management website)(Harvardx project)
    - 8 Problem sets (Harvardx CS50)   
 - I am honing my skills and am enthusiastic and excited to keep on learning and given a chance I want to get into research and start working on my subject as soon as possible, and become industry-ready and especially future ready.
